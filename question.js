It is a specification which specifies the working of Java Virtual Machine. Its implementation has been provided by Oracle and other companies. Its implementation is known as JRE.<\/p>\r\n<p>JVMs are available for many hardware and software platforms (so JVM is platform dependent). It is a runtime instance which is created when we run the Java class.

The syntax of Java is based on C++ which makes easier to write the program in it.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<ul class=\"points\">\r\n<ul class=\"points\">\r\n<li><strong>Object-Oriented:<\/strong>&nbsp;Java follows the object-oriented paradigm which allows us to maintain our code as the combination of different type of objects that incorporates both data and behavior.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<ul class=\"points\">\r\n<ul class=\"points\">\r\n<li><strong>Portable:<\/strong>&nbsp;Java supports read-once-write-anywhere approach. We can execute the Java program on every machine. Java program (.java) is converted to bytecode (.class) which can be easily run on every machine.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<ul class=\"points\">\r\n<ul class=\"points\">\r\n<li><strong>Platform Independent:<\/strong>&nbsp;Java is a platform independent programming language. It is different from other programming languages like C and C++ which needs a platform to be executed. Java comes with its platform on which its code is executed. Java doesn't depend upon the operating system to be executed.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<ul class=\"points\">\r\n<ul class=\"points\">\r\n<li><strong>Secured:<\/strong>&nbsp;Java is secured because it doesn't use explicit pointers. Java also provides the concept of ByteCode and Exception handling which makes it more secured.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<ul class=\"points\">\r\n<ul class=\"points\">\r\n<li><strong>Robust:<\/strong>&nbsp;Java is a strong programming language as it uses strong memory management. The concepts like Automatic garbage collection, Exception handling, etc. make it more robust.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<ul class=\"points\">\r\n<ul class=\"points\">\r\n<li><strong>Architecture Neutral:<\/strong>&nbsp;Java is architectural neutral as it is not dependent on the architecture. In C, the size of data types may vary according to the architecture (32 bit or 64 bit) which doesn't exist in Java.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<ul class=\"points\">\r\n<ul class=\"points\">\r\n<li><strong>Interpreted:<\/strong>&nbsp;Java uses the Just-in-time (JIT) interpreter along with the compiler for the program execution.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<ul class=\"points\">\r\n<ul class=\"points\">\r\n<li><strong>High Performance:<\/strong>&nbsp;Java is faster than other traditional interpreted programming languages because Java bytecode is \"close\" to native code. It is still a little bit slower than a compiled language (e.g., C++).<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<ul class=\"points\">\r\n<ul class=\"points\">\r\n<li><strong>Multithreaded:<\/strong>&nbsp;We can write Java programs that deal with many tasks at once by defining multiple threads. The main advantage of multi-threading is that it doesn't occupy memory for each thread. It shares a common memory area. Threads are important for multi-media, Web applications, etc.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<ul class=\"points\">\r\n<ul class=\"points\">\r\n<li><strong>Distributed:<\/strong>&nbsp;Java is distributed because it facilitates users to create distributed applications in Java. RMI and EJB are used for creating distributed applications. This feature of Java makes us able to access files by calling the methods from any machine on the internet.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<ul class=\"points\">\r\n<li><strong>Dynamic:<\/strong>&nbsp;Java is a dynamic language. It supports dynamic loading of classes. It means classes are loaded on demand. It also supports functions from its native languages, i.e., C and C++.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>",
