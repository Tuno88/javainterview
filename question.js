        "answer":"<p><code><\/code><\/p>\r\n<h3 class=\"h4\">JVM<\/h3>\r\n<p>JVM is an acronym for Java Virtual Machine; it is an abstract machine which provides the runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be executed. It is a specification which specifies the working of Java Virtual Machine. Its implementation has been provided by Oracle and other companies. Its implementation is known as JRE.<\/p>\r\n<p>JVMs are available for many hardware and software platforms (so JVM is platform dependent). It is a runtime instance which is created when we run the Java class. There are three notions of the JVM: specification, implementation, and instance.<\/p>\r\n<h3 class=\"h4\">JRE<\/h3>\r\n<p>JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment. It is the implementation of JVM. The Java Runtime Environment is a set of software tools which are used for developing Java applications. It is used to provide the runtime environment. It is the implementation of JVM. It physically exists. It contains a set of libraries + other files that JVM uses at runtime.<\/p>\r\n<h3 class=\"h4\">JDK<\/h3>\r\n<p>JDK is an acronym for Java Development Kit. It is a software development environment which is used to develop Java applications and applets. It physically exists. It contains JRE + development tools. JDK is an implementation of any one of the below given Java Platforms released by Oracle Corporation:<\/p>\r\n<ul class=\"points\">\r\n<li>Standard Edition Java Platform<\/li>\r\n<li>Enterprise Edition Java Platform<\/li>\r\n<li>Micro Edition Java Platform<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>",
